- Presentation of ChebyshevU and LegendreP are strongly prone to a big round
  off error!

- what to do with SphericalHarmonicDecomp_Read

## ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ##

- interpolation [done]

- replace double to Real [done]

- comments in the code[done]

- no imaginary interpolation needed [done]

- compiler warnings[done]

- why can't we call SphericalHarmonicDecomp_DumpMetric a few times?[done]

- memory leak[done]: it seems the new call acted on static data type so new
  delete is necessary to avoid leak

- how about when we have a restart? [done], I don't see any concern

- parallelism [done] all array should transferred to master thread to write

- do we need gsl lib?[done] Yes, for matric inversion

- various macros are defined in the src files, ensure we active the correct
ones.[done]
