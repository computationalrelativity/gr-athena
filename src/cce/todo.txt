- what to do with SphericalHarmonicDecomp_Read

- interpolation

- how about when we have a restart?

- memory leak

- parallelism

- various macros are defined in the src files, ensure we active the correct
ones.

- replace double to Real

- Presentation of ChebyshevU and LegendreP are strongly prone to a big round
  off error!

- no imaginary interpolation needed [done]

- compiler warnings[done]

- why can't we call SphericalHarmonicDecomp_DumpMetric a few times?[done]
